\title{STAR Experiment Dataset}
\format{
A data frame with 68 observations (classrooms) and 4 variables:
\describe{
  \item{school}{Integer. School ID (1-16), serving as strata in the stratified randomized experiment}
  \item{classroom}{Integer. Classroom identifier within each school}
  \item{treatment}{Integer. Treatment indicator (1 = small class (13-17 students), 0 = regular class (22-25 students))}
  \item{outcome}{Double. Standardized average mathematics score}

\description{
A dataset from Imbens and Rubin (2015) containing data from the Student/Teacher
Achievement Ratio (STAR) experiment conducted in 1985-1986 in Tennessee. This was
a large-scale randomized experiment to evaluate the effect of class size on
student achievement. The data is in long format with schools serving as strata.
}
\details{
The STAR experiment was a 4-year study comparing student performance in small
classes (13-17 students) versus regular classes (22-25 students). Students were
randomly assigned within schools, making this a stratified randomized experiment
where schools serve as strata. The outcome represents standardized mathematics
scores, allowing for comparison across different assessment scales.

This dataset represents a subset of the original STAR data, focusing on the
first year of the experiment with mathematics scores as the primary outcome
of interest.
