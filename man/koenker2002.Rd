\description{
A dataset from Koenker and Xiao (2002) containing data from a job training program
stratified on quarter. The dataset contains information on the duration before
employment for participants in a randomized controlled trial evaluating the
effectiveness of job training programs. This is a stratified randomized experiment
where quarters serve as strata.
}
\details{
The dataset represents a job training program evaluation where participants were
randomized to receive job training or serve as controls. Randomization was
stratified by quarter to ensure balance across time periods. The primary outcome
is the duration before employment, representing the time it took for participants
to find employment after the intervention.
