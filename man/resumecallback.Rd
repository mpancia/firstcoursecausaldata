\description{
A dataset from Bertrand and Mullainathan (2004) studying racial discrimination
in the labor market. The researchers conducted a randomized experiment by
sending fictitious resumes with either Black-sounding or White-sounding names
to help-wanted ads in Boston and Chicago newspapers to measure the effect
of perceived race on callback rates for interviews.
