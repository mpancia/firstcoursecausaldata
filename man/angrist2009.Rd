\description{
A dataset from Angrist et al. (2009) containing data from a randomized experiment
conducted at a Canadian university to evaluate different strategies to improve
academic performance among college freshmen. The data focuses on the control group
and the treatment group offered academic support services and financial incentives
for good grades.
}
\details{
The experiment randomly assigned college freshmen to different treatment conditions
including academic support services (SFP, SSP, SFSP) and financial incentives for good
grades. The primary outcomes are academic performance measures such as GPA in the
first and second years, completion rates, and academic standing.
