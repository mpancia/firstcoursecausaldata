\description{
A dataset from Gould (1998) containing summary statistics from a stratified
randomized trial studying the efficacy and tolerability of finasteride for
treating benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Within each of the 29 centers,
patients were randomized into three arms: control, finasteride 1mg, and
finasteride 5mg. The centers serve as strata in this stratified randomized
experiment (SRE).
}
\details{
The outcome is the change from baseline in total symptom score for BPH.
The total symptom score ranges from 0 to 36 (sum of 9 questions, each scored 0-4)
about symptoms of impaired urinary ability. Negative values indicate improvement
in symptoms.
